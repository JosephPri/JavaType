# My Personal Project 

## JavaType - *Typing speed and accuracy testing app*

**Proposal Paragraph:**
I would like to design a typing test application in Java. It will be able to calculate your WPM (words per minute), accuracy rate, save previous tests, have different difficulties. It will have a simple and sleek user interface so that anyone wanting to improve their typing speed (ex. students) will be able to use it. I'm interested in this project because I enjoy building mechanical keyboards and also wish to improve my typing abilities.
